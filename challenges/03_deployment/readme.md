# Create a Deployment

- Run 3 identical pods of the pod we have previously created (using a deployment).

- Check if the deployment was created succesfully

- Check if we have 3 pods beloging to the deployment. Have a closer look at the names.

If you need any help check out the [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/).
