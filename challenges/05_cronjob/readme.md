# Create a CronJob

- Create a CronJob, which creates a pod every minute that echos the string "Hello from the Kubernetes Cluster"

- Confirm if the CronJob is created and running

- Look for the pods created by the cronjob an ensure that their log output is correct.

If you need any help check out the [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/).
