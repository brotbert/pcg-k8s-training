# Basic Kubectl Commands

- Find the following info using kubectl:
  - How many nodes does the cluster have?
  - What namespaces are there?
  - Which pods run in the "kube-system" namespace?
  - Which pods are running on one of the nodes?
  - What is in the logs from kube-dns or any other pod? (kube-dns is running the kube-system namespace)
